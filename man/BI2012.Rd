\details{
The Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW) includes wealth and other aspects of households' economic and financial behaviour such 
as, for instance, which payment methods are used. The original 2012 survey covers 8,151 households and 20,022 units, distributed over 
about 300 Italian municipalities. Here, a sample of 200 randomly selected units from the original 2012 survey is considered. We remark 
that the weight associated with each selected household is defined by the replication weight provided by the Bank of Italy. Note that the total net 
income Y corresponds to the sum of the six income sources: YL, YTP, YTA, YM, YCA, YCF.}
