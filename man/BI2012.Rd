\details{
The Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SIHW) includes wealth and other aspects of households' economic and financial behaviour such 
as, for instance, which payment methods are used. The original 2012 survey covered 8,151 households and 20,022 units, distributed over 
about 300 Italian municipalities. Here, a sample of 200 randomly selected units from the original 2012 survey was considered. We remark 
that the weight associated to each selected household was obtained by multiplying the scale suggested by Kakwani and Lambert (1998) and 
the weight given in SHIW.}
